Bugs and Known Issues
-----------------------------------

Say where bugs can be reported / followed onto the `Bug Tracker`_

.. _Bug Tracker: http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-asdf/issues

Use this section for important warnings about problems or performance issues that are not necessarily mentioned in the bug tracker.

To Do
-----------

Give a link pointing to a roadmap_. Alternatively, you can dress up a list of things you want to add or fix. This includes smaller problems/bugs which are best described as to-do items. Can also include visions for what the extension could become with more development.

.. _roadmap: http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-asdf/roadmap


Change Log
-----------

It is recommended to provide the user with a URL pointing to a roadmap_ (Forge gives the possibility to create a Roadmap very easily). As an option, the link could point to the `repository log`_.
