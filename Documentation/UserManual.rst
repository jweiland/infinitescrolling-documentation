The extension "Infinite Scrolling" is replacing the page browser at the bottom with an endless scrolling feature. This
function has become popular with applications like Twitter and Facebook. When viewing a list of entries, more data
records are automatically loaded from the server when you are scrolling down to the end of the page.

The result is an improved user experience, since more (or all) data records can be viewed without navigating to the
page browser and clicking on a link.

The Infinite Scrolling extension can be implemented in existing TYPO3 projects without changing the code of the
extension plugin or the HTML template.

The page browser only hidden on the page, not deleted. Therefore the page browser is still accessible, e.g. for screen
readers.
